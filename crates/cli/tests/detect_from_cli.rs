//! Detection from the shipped binary (§22, §24, §4.5).
//!
//! The library tests prove the detectors classify and the resolver resolves.
//! This proves the part §4.5 cares about: that both halves of §22 are reachable
//! with no UI compiled at all - the live marker out of `vcw session`, and the
//! post-capture pass out of `vcw detect`, evidence and all.
//!
//! The simulated source is uniform noise, so the only boundary a side of it can
//! have is the one at its start. That is enough for what is being tested here,
//! which is the plumbing rather than the classification: `tests/vripr_parity.rs`
//! in `vcw-signal` is where the classification is measured, against 595 real
//! sides' worth of material.
