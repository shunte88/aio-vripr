//! WP-10's exit criterion: gapless seek and honest fidelity, through the
//! shipped binary.
//!
//! The subject is the `vcw` process, not the library, for the reason
//! `session_from_cli.rs` gives: §2 and §4.5 are about whether the application
//! can be driven with no UI present, and a test calling the Rust API would not
//! tell the difference.
//!
//! Every test here runs with no sound card. `vcw play --render` puts the bytes
//! the converter would have been handed into a file, which is what makes
//! "gapless" a comparison rather than an opinion - a gap is invisible from
//! outside a device, and a device that was fed silence reports the same success
//! as one that was fed music. The one thing rendering cannot measure is the
//! wall-clock delay before a seek reaches the converter on real hardware;
//! `vcw-core/tests/playback_live.rs` measures that and states the number.
